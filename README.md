# Chatbot
# 🗨️ Rule-Based ChatBot in Python

This is a simple **rule-based chatbot** built using core Python concepts. It simulates a basic conversational agent that responds to user queries using keyword matching.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Greets the user at the start of the conversation
* Accepts continuous user input in a loop
* Matches keywords like:

  * `course`
  * `fees`
  * `timing`
  * `location`
* Responds using a predefined knowledge base (dictionary)
* Handles greetings such as `hi`, `hello`, `hey`
* Exits gracefully when the user types `bye`

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Language:** Python 3
* **Concepts Applied:**

  * Object-Oriented Programming (Classes & Objects)
  * Dictionaries for storing knowledge
  * Conditional Statements (`if/else`)
  * Loops (`while True`)
  * Functions and method calls
  * String processing (`lower()`, `strip()`)
